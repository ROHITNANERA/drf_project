# Django Rest Framework API for Healthcare Management

Welcome to my Django Rest Framework project! I developed this API during my learning journey with Django Rest Framework. This robust API allows you to store crucial data related to hospitals, doctors, and patients. Patients can even rate their hospital experience, providing valuable feedback.

## Key Features
- **Authentication:** Secure and authenticate users accessing the API.
- **Throttling:** Implement efficient throttling mechanisms for controlled API access.
- **Pagination:** Manage large datasets effortlessly with built-in pagination.
- **Data Management:** Store comprehensive information about hospitals, doctors, and patients.
- **Rating System:** Enable patients to rate hospitals, enhancing user engagement and feedback.

I created this project to showcase my skills in building scalable and secure APIs using Django Rest Framework. It's a testament to my understanding of authentication protocols, data management, and user experience. Feel free to explore the codebase and offer any suggestions for improvement. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
